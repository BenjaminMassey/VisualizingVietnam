# Visualizing Vietnam

## About

This is a project made to demonstrate the statistics of the Vietnam War
through various kinds of data visualization. This was done as a research
project as a part of my pursuing of a Digital Humanities minor, and hoped
to combine my study of both Computer Science and Political Science. It is
made with Virtual Reality (mainly the Oculus Quest) in mind, and was created
using the Unity Engine and C# scripting.
