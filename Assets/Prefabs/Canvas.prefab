  - "The conflict in Vietnam \u2014 never officially declared a war by the United
    States \u2014 is well known in the United States to have killed many Americans."
  - This is an important fact for people to note, because it truly is horrific how
    many young Americans the US sent to die overseas.
  - That being said, there is often too much of a focus on this American tragedy,
    and not the tragedy that was put upon the Vietnamese people.
  - On the tables in front of you, toy soldiers are about to fall from the sky that
    represent the number of casualties during the conflict.
  - On the left table, there will be American casualties.
  - On the right table, there will be Vietnamese casualties.
  - Each soldier represents ten thousand people killed, and a new soldier will appear
    every half second.
  - Let us begin.
  - 
  - "You probably noticed that the left side \u2014 representing American losses
    \u2014 has already stopped having new soldiers."
  - It only took three seconds to reach our end of the American losses.
  - The US officially lost around 58,000 soldiers in the conflict, which is represented
    by those six toy soldiers on the left.
  - This is still a terrible loss, of course, but is currently being overshadowed
    by the still falling Vietnamese on the right.
  - 
  - After one full minute, the right side has stopped dropping new soldiers.
  - These 121 toy soldiers represent the approximately 1.2 million Vietnamese soldiers
    who died during the conflict
  - " \u2014 110,000 from South Vietnam, and 1.1 million from the North."
  - This loss of life is extremely hard to comprehend, and while this experience
    does its best to demonstrate the numbers via space and time,
  - there is no doubt that the sheer brutality is impossible to truly understand
    from any virtual application.
  - Disclaimers aside, we are actually not quite done with our story regarding loss
    of life.
  - To the surprise of zero historians, the civilian loss of life during the Vietnam
    conflict is an important statistic that has been ignored thus far.
  - In order to rectify this, let us begin, yet again, the dropping of toy soldiers.
  - This time, they will be colored yellow in order to differentiate them from the
    soldiers.
  - Like before, each toy will represent 10,000 people, this time civilians, and
    one will be dropped every half second.
  - 
  - After twenty and a half seconds, the visualization of Vietnamese civilian deaths
    has completed.
  - "These 41 yellow toy soldiers represent the estimated 415,000 Vietnamese citizens
    that were murdered during the United States\u2019 involvement in Vietnam."
  - All because of the blind fear of communism, it was decided by the most powerful
    nation in the world
  - that over 400,000 non-fighting human beings deserved to die.
  - "More specifically, they died because of the worry labeled the \u201CDomino Effect\u201D:"
  - the idea proposed by Western powers that if Vietnam fell to communism, then it
    would spread to the rest of Asia.
  - That is to emphasize that the United States committed these killings not for
    the sake of stopping a world-changing communist superpower,
  - but rather a small, impoverished nation that State interests deemed was getting
    out of line.
  - 'Just to reiterate, none of this visualization is to delegitimize the number
    of Americans killed:'
  - their deaths are just as much of a tragedy.
  - 'That being said, this demonstration hoped to prove the sheer devastation that
    our anti-communist mission put upon the Vietnamese people:'
  - an idea that often takes a backseat in American discussion.
  -
